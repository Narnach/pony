= Pony, the express way to send email in Ruby

== Overview

Ruby no longer has to be jealous of PHP's mail() function, which can send an email in a single command.

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :from => 'me@example.com', :subject => 'hi', :body => 'Hello there.')

Any option key may be omitted except for :to.

== Transport

Pony uses /usr/sbin/sendmail to send mail if it is available, otherwise it uses SMTP to localhost.

This can be over-ridden if you specify a via option

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :smtp) # sends via SMTP
  
  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :sendmail) # sends via sendmail

You can also specify options for SMTP:

  Pony.mail(:to => 'you@example.com', :via => :smtp, :smtp => {
    :host     => 'smtp.yourserver.com',
    :port     => '25',
    :user     => 'user',
    :password => 'pass',
    :auth     => :plain,           # :plain, :login, :cram_md5, no auth by default
    :domain   => "example.com"     # the HELO domain provided by the client to the server
  }

== TLS

To use TLS in ruby 1.8.6, install the smtp_tls gem. Ruby 1.8.7 has built-in TLS support.
